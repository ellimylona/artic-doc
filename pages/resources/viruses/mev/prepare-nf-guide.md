**Overview:** 

This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use prepare-nf in EPI2ME, Oxford Nanopore Technologiesâ€™ cloud-based data analysis platform. It can be used to create a sample sheet to be used as input file in the ARTIC bioinformatics amplicon-nf pipeline on a Desktop or Laptop computer without having to use a command-line interface.


**Requirements:**

* EPI2ME installed. Further instructions can be found at XXX.
* Internet access to download the pipeline, and for the first time running it. After that, you should be able to run it offline.
* Details about sample names, barcode assignment, and any other metadata required for analysis. These should be collated in a CSV or XLS file using the template in XXX, and containing the following required columns:
	* Sample name (e.g., sample1)
	* Barcode (e.g. barcode01)
	* any other columns with additional information
