content="**Overview:** This guide provides step-by-step instructions on how to use prepare-nf in EPI2ME, Oxford Nanopore Technologies’ cloud-based data analysis platform. It can be used to create a sample sheet to be used as input file in the ARTIC bioinformatics amplicon-nf pipeline on a Desktop or Laptop computer without having to use a command-line interface."

**Requirements:**

* EPI2ME installed. Further instructions can be found at XXX.
* Internet access to download the pipeline, and for the first time running it. After that, you should be able to run it offline.
* Details about sample names, barcode assignment, and any other metadata required for analysis.

## Using the ARTIC prepare-nf analysis pipeline in EPI2ME

## ---

### **Import the workflow**

Open EPI2ME. From the left hand side panel, select "Launch".

Then select “Import workflow” and "Import from Github".

A pop-up window will appear where you can enter the GitHub URL. Enter the URL and click “Download” ([https://github.com/artic-network/prepare-nf](https://github.com/artic-network/prepare-nf "Prepare-nf download link")):

Once it has downloaded, it will be ready in the Available Workflows tab. Select it and you will be taken to a landing page for this workflow.

### **Running the workflow**

From the workflow landing page, click “Run this workflow”.

Then select “Run on your computer” and click “Continue”.

It will then ask you to select your fastq folders. Select the ones you want and continue.

Go to the Primer Scheme Selection tab and **make sure that the primer scheme matches the one you used**. If your scheme is not listed, you can use the “Custom scheme” section to provide the full path to the directory containing your appropriately named scheme bed and fasta files; \<SCHEME\_NAME\>.bed and \<SCHEME\_NAME\>.fasta.

Finally click “Launch workflow”. It will then start running. The runtime will depend on the size of your files and the speed of your computer, but 10-30 minutes is common. While it is running you will see a series of progress bars, and at the top a blue ‘Running’ icon. This will change to green and ‘Complete’ when it has finished.

When it has finished you will have a collection of outputs for both consensus and individual barcodes.

## Advanced Options

### **Changing the pipeline version**

If you need to use a previous or a development version of the pipeline, this can be selected from the workflow landing page.

### **Changing the basecaller**

Medaka runs within the pipeline to call variants between the reads provided and the reference. It will try to auto-select. If it is unable to auto-select (for example if your data was basecalled with a version of MinKNOW which is no longer supported) you may need to choose an option from this drop down list of available models in “Advance Options” (scroll down).

**We recommend you use a supported version of MinKNOW**. As a work around, you should select an option from this list of models which matches the flowcell chemistry and sequencing speed.
